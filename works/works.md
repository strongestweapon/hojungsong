While people have enticed with the fact, Hojun Song turns their attentions to subjects like heroisms and nationalisms in science, a present-day role of an amateur, and sharing sensitive technologies by a series of comedic and satirical performances. 

## On Off Everything
2018, 2019  
On Off Everything project presents repetitive ons and offs of a group of electronic devices brought by the audiences. An electronic device is A SYSTEM that consists of many parts and its on off timings, lights, and sounds are all different for each device. So when all the devices are connected to the installation and its main central power is switched on and off periodically, a very unexpected audio visual combination can occur. 

## Time To Leave The Land

'Time to Leave The Land' project uses a sailboat to create a floating and isolated near-future storytelling studio. The project examines topics on off-grid ocean living in the era of pandemic and virtual reality. Along with scientists, artists, musicians, and writers, the boat sails distant seas to complete a short science fiction zine together. The converstion on the boat is live streamed for on-site collaobration with audiences. The sailing and the zine publishing are planned quarterly.

## Don't Compress Me
2009, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018  
Don't Compress Me is a project in which participants do their best to create movements for 10 seconds, so that their movements(existence) are not easily compressed by the video compression algorithm. Participants stand in front of a camera and take 10 seconds video, and the least compressed person, the largest file size after compression, wins. Random movements should interfere with the efficiency of compression codecs such as H.264, but in fact, as soon as they recognized, they fall into irony of not moving randomly. How can we move and think outside of the A.I.'s predictions?

## The Great Explosion
2020  
The Great Explosion project collects voices from particpants as materials for the explosion simulation. Voices are mapped to exploded fragments’ energies and trajectories and are condensed to explode. A noise like people’s voices played at once, a higly loaded, overdrived computer, and a video of sync and chaos give us chances to think between a simulated disaster and a existing one like Covid 19.

## ANTI- A.I. Vocalization Techniques
2018  
How can we trick A.I.-based speech recognition system while a human can understand the speech? And by not changing the context of the speech? Able to deceive google cloud speech recognition by changing intonations and by inserting special white noise sounds in between syllables. A.I. kills the diversity. Deny the bias.

## gold & silver
2017, 2018  
gold & silver is a experimental, improvisational music band of 2 members - Hojun Song and Sangback Choe. gold & silver does a very kind experimental music by actively communicating with audiences about what and why they are trying to do something at the concert. For example, the band shares the improvised song titles and why they come up with them, so that the audiences can also imagine while listening. When performed well, the audiences can even sing together on a improvised sound. Oh, the band even make the concert fee to minus - giving out some money to the audiences, so the band can fail big time without feeling guilty. The current band setup is composed of modular synthesizers and real drums.

## GODLED Electronics
2010, 2016

The current lineups are Buddha (LG-BUD-6036), Jesus (LW-JES-7620), Mary (LB-MAR- 4125), and Ganesh (LR-GAN-6036) and are going to be produced in Q3 2021.

## For Humanity - Einstein Merong
2016  
Even after the Trinity experiment where the power of a nuclear bomb was seen and even after the fall of Germany, the manhattan project didn't stop and nuclear bombed the 2 major Japanese cities. Including Albert Einstein, many scientists later kind of regret and apologized about the project, but still the question remains. Were they, the geniuses, really not able to stop the project before the bombing? While the audience sees the golden framed tiny tiny text about the manhattan project up close, the video of Einstein next to the audience turns to famous Einstein tongue out gesture - known as for humanity gesture from normal face. Tease Ya! 

## Divided We Stand, United We Fall
2015  
Divided We Stand, United We Fall. The deconstruction of a hero. A manifesto for diversity. ANTI-A.I.

## Poomba
2015  
Awarded as the winner of Ilmac Art prize 2015, Hojun Song's solo exhibition was held. But there were no physical creations. Deconstruction of heroes. Restoration of romance. Two collided heavily, only thing the artist could do was asking questions as creating something and showed to the audience seemed to be violent. The poomba was an Korean character from the end of Goryeo dynasty and was a satirist, much like a clown, but also a beggar, and a street monk respected by people for his/her wisdoms. Poomba was a self disrespecting, a hero-deconstructing hero. So the Poomba of the future became the theme of the exhibition to talk about two collided subjects. 4 talks and 4 workshops to become future poomba were held at the exhibition site including construction site nearby and live streamed. Camping and swimming at the construction site, inviting people to the site every night for drinks. 


## LED That Blinks Once Every 100 Years
2010, 2015  
A cheap small 5mm LED blink every 100 years. The idea began in 2010 and almost realized as a public art project in 2015. A 2 meter high spherical structure would be machined to contain inert gas filled LED module vacuum chamber. Nuclear batteries were used as main power for 100 year operation and passive heating system was designed from thermal simulations. The project was rejected by juries of the local public art committee as Hojun Song turned down their proposal to blink the LED every year.

## dssb
2014  
dssb is a death metal-ish band of 2 members - Hojun Song and Jinhwa Jeong. The band's formation was highly influenced by the Sewol ferry disaster that led 304 passengers to death and the helpless Korean society in 2014.

## Hello 90
2014  
In Korea, bowing is used in greetings or required to express thanks. But when the bowing is combined with the macho in its extreme, it almost becomes a fear response to the strong. While the normal angle of the bowing is 30-40 degree, the extreme macho bowing is 90 degree angle. The angular velocity of the bowing should also be much faster than the normal bowing. The volume of saying hello should also be much louder. This extreme macho bowing is very common among gangsters and military people but is also common among college clubs and k-pop idols. Hello 90 is an interactive video installation that shows people bowing in 90 degree when you enter a space.

## Prove It: For ~~The Betterment Of~~ Mankind
2014  
Prove It: For The Betterment Of Mankind report was the curatorial research and exhibition plan for a section of the opening exhibition of Asian Culture Center, Gwangju, Korea. Air bending vs Large Hadron Collider. How come only a few interested in air bending while nations spend billions of money for LHC at Cern. Is this about pseudo vs real science? Or is this about which can make world better? What is the betterment? Experts prove, people believe. Believe is the word as most of the people cannot understand. Whether it be pseudo or real, we can question these stupid and fundamental questions by juxtaposing extreme yet somewhat unrelated well-known proving efforts side by side. Air bending vs LHC, a man hikes up to mountain with atomic clock to feel the existence of the time, human echolocation of blind people, Dynasphere machine to produce love Qi for world peace, quantum consciousness, and etc. *The exhibition could not be made due to the replacement of the director.

## ANTI-Climax
2013  
ANTI-Climax is a show by Hojun Song shown at the opening of MMCA, Seoul. Collaborated with actor, Taeyoung Kang, actress, Eun-ah Suh, and the band Idiotape, the show talks about deconstructing formerly gained authorities of the art work to create next one. Starting with ostentatious non-sense talking LED poets, the show continues to improvised self-confession cross-computer chatting, calling out every audiences' names, flower rope suicides, and ended with loud music in the holy contemporary art museum. Clumsy graphics design, fake sculptures were in front, technologies and media were shown but hidden. Only 3 people danced out of hundreds of audiences.

## Apple
2010, 2017, 2018  
Apple ripens as it gets attentions from people. When people take a picture of the apple with flash, it slowly turns red from green and produces eerie sounds. 400 light and sound modules work independently toward the synced state.

## Uranium Necklace
2010, 2013, 2016  
Unranium Necklace is for those who want to commit suicide. Taste the death before making a final decision. We need stronger materials to taste the death. Drugs are not enough. Upon buying the jewelry, the length of the stainless wire necklace is adjusted with wire stopper so you cannot take it off. Tried selling an uranium necklace in ebay for 900,000 USD but got comment saying a life was cheaper than 900,000 USD.

## The Strongest Weapon In The World
2007, 2009, 2010  
The strongest weapon in the world project presents a series of tries to build an indestructible weapon that DOES NOT attack the opponent. The first one a.k.a Weapons of Mass Happiness was a heavy aluminum casted spherical shape weapon equipped with geiger counter for radioactive particle detection and a printer for spit out messages when triggered by nuclear explosion. The second strongest weapon in the world was built with students of K-SAD with custom letter engravings on cow bones to emphasize that indestructible data is the the ultimate weapon. In 2010, the third version - I Love You weapon was made. Armored with thick SC45 steel and with piezo sensor sound module inside, when hit with construction hammer, it says 'I love you' to the attacker.

## Sync-O-Light
